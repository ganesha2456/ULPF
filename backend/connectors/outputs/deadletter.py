"""
Dead-letter store for one output: events TRACELOG could not deliver, kept on disk
as one JSON line each, and re-sent later.

    data/dead_letter/<output>.ndjson             waiting to be re-sent
    data/dead_letter/<output>.replaying.ndjson   claimed by a replay that is running (or was cut off)
    data/dead_letter/<output>.replaying.offset   bytes of the claimed file already delivered

Each line:
    {"kind": "undeliverable" | "rejected" | "queue_full", "reason": "...", "at": "<ISO time>",
     "attempts": 6, "source": "Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS (PA-3220)", "output": "splunk", "event": {OCSF}}

kinds:
    undeliverable  every retry failed (destination down, timeout, HTTP 408/429/5xx). Safe to re-send as is.
    queue_full     the output's queue overflowed during a burst. Safe to re-send as is.
    rejected       the destination refused the event (HTTP 4xx, mapping or validation error). Re-sending
                   only helps once the cause is fixed (token, index mapping, payload size).

A replay claims the waiting file by renaming it, so new dead letters keep landing
in a fresh file while it runs. After each batch the destination accepts, the
delivered position is saved. If the destination fails, a limit is reached or
TRACELOG stops, the claimed file stays with its position and the next replay
continues from there, so at most one batch is ever sent twice. Entries skipped
(other kinds) or refused again go back to the waiting file. Nothing is deleted
until it has been delivered.
